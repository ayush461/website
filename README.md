this is just for practice
this is a demo website
MAIN POINTS.
in this u have to try fork,clone,set upstream,fix issue and push.
1st you have to fork
then, clone it to local computer
cd (project name): this is used to open a folder
then make a new branch, because you don't want to mess with the main branch
 git remote add upstream (link)
then edit it 
then add
then git commit
then git status
then push it

thank u
